In this Suicide Case Study, I tried to solve the following data analysis and prediction :-
-Total suicides in India,
-Total suicides in India state wise,
-Total suicides in India year wise
-Total suicides in India gender wise
-Total suicides in India state-year wise
-Total suicides in India state-gender wise
-Total suicides in India year-gender wise
-Total suicides in India state-year-gender wise
-Predict future suicides in India using machine learning algorithms
-Predict future suicides in India using machine learning linear regression algorithm
-Predict future suicides in India using machine learning polynomial regression algorithm
